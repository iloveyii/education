      - Final Project: Cell Analysis - [Github Link](https://github.com/iloveyii/cell-analysis)
        - AIM
          - Facilitate integration of FCM-based assessment of drinking water quality into drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) routines, and by doing this, understand the dynamics of microbial communities in biologically activated filtration (BAF), and other, drinking water production and distribution processes. This will support and facilitate engineering decisions to improve production, maintenance and monitoring routines at DWTP for sustainable production of safe drinking water.
        - Purpose
          - To create computer-based tools that simplify and streamline data interpretation of large image-based data sets generated during flow cytometricanalysis of bacteria, for monitoring of sustainable production of drinking water.
        - Flow cytometricanalysis
          - Flow cytometry is routinely used in basic research, clinical practice, andclinical trials. Uses for flow cytometry include:
            - Cell counting
            - Cell sorting•Determining cell characteristics and function
            - Detectingmicroorganisms•Biomarkerdetection
            - Protein engineeringdetection
            - Diagnosis of health disorders such asblood cancers
          - A flow cytometry analyzer is an instrument that provides quantifiable data from a sample. Other instruments using flow cytometry include cell sorters which physically separate and thereby purify cells of interest based on their optical properties.

The general theory of the algorithms was discussed during the lectures. You shall use available open source libraries or write Python codes of your own to analyze the data. If you use the available libraries, you may have to customize the code to meet your requirements.
          - * Produce a regression model for the given dataset. You may use Octave, Matlab or another tool (Python based). Compare and evaluate different regression models. Which type of model is recommended? Why?
